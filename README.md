# Employee-Salary-Dataset
The employee salary data set needs to be analysed based on salary, department, and designation. Use the COUNTIFS function to count employees based on two criteria: department and designation, or vice versa. 
Use the AVERAGEIFS function to analyse employee annual salaries by department and designation. 
Analyse the top ten highest salaries of employees. Similarly, the data has been examined using a PIVOT table.
